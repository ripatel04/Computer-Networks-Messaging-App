Packet Tracer Network Topology   
For this project, Cisco Packet Tracer was used to build an extensive network architecture that would accommodate a big office setting. The topology combines many network architectures to provide great speed, security, and scalability over diverse office areas.  

**Star Topology:** A centralized framework for effective fault isolation and management.  
**Bus Topology:** A method of reducing cable utilization within individual offices.  
Network segments in technicians' offices are divided using a hierarchical topology to improve traffic control and security.  
**Static IP Addressing:** Enhances security and management by guaranteeing uniform IP addressing.  
**Connectivity:** Raised floor design and a large number of wired connectors make cable management simple.  
**Resource Distribution:** Arranging shared resources and networked printers strategically to maximize workflow.  
**Security:** Network segmentation and robust authentication are necessary for safe access.  
VPN servers that provide safe remote access are available for remote work support.  

A hybrid topology is used in the network architecture to produce a scalable, secure, and adaptable network environment.  

Messaging App Development  
The messaging software was created to enable effective and safe communication in the workplace. Principal attributes and noteworthy advancements comprise:  

**User authentication:** To guarantee allowed access, secure registration and login procedures are used.  
**Real-time messaging:** Provides dependable message delivery and instantaneous user communication.  
**Group Chats:** Facilitates communication between users in specific groups for the purpose of collaborating on projects.  
**File exchange:** Enables the exchange of documents and files during chat sessions.  
**User Interface:** To improve the user experience, intuitive and user-friendly design is used.  
**Backend:** Sturdy server-side logic for managing user requests, storing, and retrieving messages.  
**Security:** Messages are encrypted to preserve user privacy and secure data.
